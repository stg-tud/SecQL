/**
 * Packaged trait for all relational algebra optimizations.
 * Note that trait mixin order is important.
 * The basic idea is that normalization comes first, i.e., selection conditions are split up into multiple operators.
 * The various optimizations currently require no order, but fusion has to come last, i.e.,
 * creating fused functions for selection operations.
